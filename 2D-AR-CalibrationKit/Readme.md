# Calibration and Augmented Reality

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a project on Calibration and Augmented Reality developed as part of CS 5330 - Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision in Spring 2024. The project aims to develop a system capable of calibrating a camera, detecting a target pattern (such as a checkerboard), and accurately placing virtual objects within the scene in real-time using computer vision techniques.

## Introduction
The project's primary goal is to seamlessly integrate virtual objects into real-world scenes captured by a camera. It involves several key steps, including:
- Detecting and Extracting Target Corners
- Selecting Calibration Images
- Calibrating the Camera
- Calculating the Current Position of the Camera
- Projecting Outside Corners or 3D Axes
- Creating Virtual Objects
- Detecting Robust Features

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific task. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Detection and Extraction of Target Corners**: This module focuses on detecting and extracting corners of a predefined pattern, such as a checkerboard, within a video stream or series of images. It utilizes OpenCV's capabilities for corner detection and refinement.

2. **Selection of Calibration Images**: This module enables users to specify calibration images and saves corner locations along with corresponding 3D world points.

3. **Camera Calibration**: This module performs camera calibration using collected calibration frames, ensuring accurate intrinsic camera parameters and distortion coefficients.

4. **Calculating the Current Position of the Camera**: This module estimates the camera's position in real-time using pose estimation techniques, projecting 3D points onto the image plane.

5. **Projection of Outside Corners or 3D Axes**: This module enhances the system to project 3D points or axes onto the image plane in real-time.

6. **Creation of Virtual Objects**: This module extends the system to create and project virtual objects in 3D space onto the image, maintaining correct orientation as the camera or target moves.


## Extensions
The project includes extensions to enhance its functionality:
- Support for multiple targets in the scene
- Comparison of camera calibrations and results for different cameras
- Integration of static images or pre-captured video sequences with virtual objects
- Manipulation of detected targets to make them look like something else
