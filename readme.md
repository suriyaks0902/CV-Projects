# Overview of Five Computer Vision Projects
Five Diverse Projects in Computer Vision: From Video Effects to Greek Letter Recognition

## Project 1: Video Special Effects using OpenCV in C++
Implements various video special effects using OpenCV in C++. The project focuses on foundational image and video processing techniques, organized into separate files for modularity and clarity.

## Project 2: Content-Based Image Retrieval Project
This project revolves around the development of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system, which serves to efficiently retrieve images from a database based on their similarity to a target image. The aim is to explore various methodologies and techniques to achieve accurate and effective image retrieval.

## Project 3: Real-time 2-D Object Recognition System
This project implements a real-time 2-D object recognition system using C++ and OpenCV. The system is designed to identify specific objects placed on a white surface, regardless of their translation, scale, or rotation. It leverages computer vision techniques to process input images or video streams from a downward-facing camera.

## Project 4: Calibration and Augmented Reality
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a project on Calibration and Augmented Reality. The project aims to develop a system capable of calibrating a camera, detecting a target pattern (such as a checkerboard), and accurately placing virtual objects within the scene in real-time using computer vision techniques.

## Project 5: Greek Letter Recognition System with PyTorch
This project implements a Greek letter recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. It initially recognizes alpha, beta, and gamma and is later extended to include additional Greek letters like delta. Various extensions such as evaluating multiple dimensions in model training, exploring pre-trained networks, and building a live video digit recognition application are included.

For detailed information on each project, please refer to their respective README files.
